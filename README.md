# Projec Goals

A gui based web development platform that will allow users to be able to create 2d games for React and react native.  Also will allow them to conntect to a firebase, mongose db, or amazon server without knowning how to code up the backend for the server.

The platform will using nodejs, react, and react-native for the development cycle.  

# Features:
  *  GUI based programming lanauge and support snapit coding in the browser using javascript, html, and css.  
  *  Vector based animation engine and drawing tool.
  *  Allow connections to mongose db, amazon server, firebase.
  *  Ability to publish apps to Android, IOS, and web browser.
  *  Create a platform for deploy react based games to windows and mac IOS.
  *  Ability to deploy apps to facebook and steam.   
  
# Consideration
  *  Learn blockchain to implement a cryptocurrency but it must meet the following requirements
     +  Cannot use more then 5% of the users gpu or cpu power on low spect computer made in 2010.
     +  Must use the lowest amount of cpu or gpu on the given machine.    
     +  The cryptocurrency should not should always between 5% higher or lower then the current worth of a dollar.
     +  The cryptocurrency system should allow a user to earn at $10 a month to allow a user to pay for services if they use the product for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Instead of paying a monthly fee for services.  Instead of paying with cash.  But the product would have to earn at lease earn $10,000 a mounth in order to pay for exepenses of running a server.  
     +  The cryptocurrency is one way paymnent and cannot be sold or traded.  
     +  It will use the community consensus mechanisms.
     +  Transactions should be limited to no more the $100 a month per person.
     +  Should allow paypal, bitcoin, or credit card.
     +  The system should be disabled by default and the user must opt in.
  *  The program itself should never use more then 10% of a users memory on a high end computer or 50% on a 10 year old or low end computer.
  *  Data storage for the applicaation itself would likely use mongose db.  
  *  Must be able to connect to an users github to store code.
  *  Login could use mongose, google, facebook, or firebase.  
  *  Mongose may be used to manage roles.
  *  User will need to connect a mongose account, firebase, amazon, microsoft, or github profile for saving data.
